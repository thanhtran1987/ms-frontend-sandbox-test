# Introduction

I have used the following supplied elements

- reactabular-table for the table layout
- MSGlyphicon.js for sort icon state sort, sort-up and sort-down
- $colorOrange for the sort counter color

I had added the following globals

- Fixture.js for init data
- Helper.js for DRY and reuse

## Test

- SortTable.test.js is mounted to test event
- SortTableHeader.test.js is shallow for render test

## Package updates

Some packages were out of date and vunerable so I updated to non breaking change version, I left the dev packages intact as they aren't a production vunerability

## Todo

- more refactoring with more time
